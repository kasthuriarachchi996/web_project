		<li>We go to great lengths to ensure good quality and we would like to give our guests the best start to the day. Therefore, we offer a delicious breakfast buffet that focuses on quality, ecology, health and, not least, good taste.

As a result, we have a large selection of breads, cheese, cold cuts, fruit and vegetables, yoghurt, eggs, breakfast products as well as various juices and, of course, tea and coffee. Several of our items in the selection have 'keyhole' certification (Nordic nutrition labelling).

For those of you who would prefer a more traditional breakfast, we also offer delicious crispy bacon and scrambled eggs as well as classic Danish pastries.</li>

<li>If you suffer from allergies, we recommend that you mention this when you book your stay so that our restaurant can accommodate any requirements for your meals.
