	<ul class="fp1">
		<li>At Imperial Hotel we guarantee check-in from 3PM, but if the room is ready upon your arrival, you are welcome to check-in before. If, on the other hand, the room is not ready when you arrive, you can store your luggage with us at no charge until the room is available.</li>



	</ul>

<h1 class="vh1">check-out</h1>

	<ul class="fp1">
			<li>Check-out from the room is at 12 noon at the latest, but if you need a late check-out, then contact our reception upon arrival, or during your stay, and we will do our best to accommodate your request. Similar to check-in, you have the option to store your luggage when checking out.</li>

	</ul>
	<h1 class="vh1">Express Check-out</h1>

	<ul class="fp1">
			<li>If you're busy and can pay with a credit card, or your accommodation is already pre-paid, you can make use of our popular Express Check-out and avoid the waiting time. Our Express Check-out stands can be found in the lobby next to the main entrance. The receipt for your stay will then be sent via e-mail on the same day.</li>
