If you are in doubt about where to eat during your visit at Imperial Hotel, do not fear. By contacting the hotel reception our competent personnel can guide you to many exciting and great "hidden" eateries. Of course, we can help you to reserve a table and give you directions on a map.
If you prefer more of the night life and a couple of drinks out on the town, we are just as well-prepared. Contact the hotel's reception for a broad selection of suggestions for cocktail bars and nightclubs </li>

If you are in doubt about what must be seen, and where they are located, please feel free to contact us at the reception. Here our extremely service-minded personnel are ready with maps, instructions and good advice.
